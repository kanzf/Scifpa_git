Automatically determined a snap distance of
0.0021 mil for layout healing.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

Layout healing changed the layout. The actual
highest aggregate snap distance was 0.0001 mil.
Further details have been written to the DRC
report.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

The port setup needed to be corrected:
Calibration will not be used for port "P17" (pin
"P17" is not on the edge between a conductive
and a nonconductive region).
