Automatically determined a snap distance of
0.0021 mil for layout healing.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

Layout healing changed the layout. The actual
highest aggregate snap distance was 0.0001 mil.
Further details have been written to the DRC
report.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

The port setup needed to be corrected:
Calibration will not be used for port "P6" (pin
"P6" is not on the edge between a conductive and
a nonconductive region).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

The port setup needed to be corrected:
Calibration will not be used for port "P8" (pin
"P8" is not on the edge between a conductive and
a nonconductive region).

The port setup needed to be corrected:
Calibration will not be used for port "P18" (pin
"P18" is not on the edge between a conductive

The port setup needed to be corrected:
Calibration will not be used for port "P20" (pin
"P20" is not on the edge between a conductive
and a nonconductive region).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

The port setup needed to be corrected:
TML calibration for port "P11" has been changed
to TML (zero length) calibration because the
transmission line of pin "P11" would otherwise
intersect with the layout.

The port setup needed to be corrected:
TML calibration for port "P12" has been changed
to TML (zero length) calibration because the
transmission line of pin "P12" would otherwise
intersect with the layout.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

The port setup needed to be corrected:
TML calibration for port "P13" has been changed
to TML (zero length) calibration because the
transmission line of pin "P13" would otherwise

to TML (zero length) calibration because the
transmission line of pin "P14" would otherwise
intersect with the layout.
