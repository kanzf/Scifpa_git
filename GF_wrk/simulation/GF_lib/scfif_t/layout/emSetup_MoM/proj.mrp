Automatically determined a snap distance of
0.0021 mil for layout healing.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

Layout healing changed the layout. The actual
highest aggregate snap distance was 0.0001 mil.
Further details have been written to the DRC
report.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

The port setup needed to be corrected:
Calibration will not be used for port "P4" (pin
"P4" is not on the edge between a conductive and
a nonconductive region).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

The port setup needed to be corrected:
Calibration will not be used for port "P5" (pin
"P5" is not on the edge between a conductive and
a nonconductive region).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

The port setup needed to be corrected:
TML calibration for port "P9" has been changed
to TML (zero length) calibration because the
transmission line of pin "P9" would otherwise
intersect with the layout.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

The port setup needed to be corrected:
TML calibration for port "P8" has been changed
to TML (zero length) calibration because the
transmission line of pin "P8" would otherwise
intersect with the layout.
